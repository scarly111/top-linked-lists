# Linked List - The Odin Project

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-linked-lists) JavaScript curriculum. The goal was to implement a basic **Linked List** data structure from scratch using JavaScript, and to practice object-oriented programming concepts.

## Features

- `append(value)` – Adds a node to the end of the list  
- `prepend(value)` – Adds a node to the beginning of the list  
- `size()` – Returns the number of nodes in the list  
- `headNode()` – Returns the first node in the list  
- `tail()` – Returns the last node in the list  
- `at(index)` – Returns the node at the given index  
- `pop()` – Removes the last node from the list  
- `toString()` – Returns a string representation of the list:  
  `( value ) -> ( value ) -> ... -> null`

## Purpose

The main purpose of this exercise is to deepen understanding of how linked lists work under the hood, and to build confidence with class-based structure and pointer-like references in JavaScript.
